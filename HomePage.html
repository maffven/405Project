                                The general philosophy of student activity is based on
                                the rule that the participation should come from students themselves,
                                and this cannot be achieved unless there is a body in which Faculty
                                members take part in it a long with students, so it was necessary to
                                establish the so-called multi-committees that fall under the student activity.

                                Each committee is headed by a faculty member in addition to a specialized
                                supervisor and five students in which one of them is the secretary of the
                                Committee. These committees propose the annual student activity programs that
                                are approved by the College Council. It is to be noted that the current
                                committees at the Faculty are:

                            <p>The ability to understand color can easily be broken down into logical methodical
                                elements.
                                <br>First, we will learn how to mix what we see by defining a color in terms of hue,
                                saturation,
                                and value.<br>
                                With this method, students will gain the capability to match any color with ease.
                                <br>Next, we will discuss the use for a split primary palette,and the effects of
                                transparent
                                color.
                                Students will understand the strengths and limitations of every color on and off their
                                palette.
